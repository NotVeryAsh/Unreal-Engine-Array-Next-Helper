The Next() function returns the next element in the array (the element with an index of n+1, or the element with an array of 0).
If the last index of the array is passed in, the function will return the first element of the array (the element with an index of 0).
If an invalid index is passed in, the function will return a nullptr.


The Next() function is defined twice.
  The first definition takes in a SizeType Index parameter which is the Index of the element that precedes the "Next" element.
  The second definition takes in an ElementType* Item parameter which is the Item that precedes the "Next" element. 
  
Having two definitions of the function allows you to search for the next element in the array, in relation to the passed in index or object.  


Supposing you have an array with 3 elements, if you initially pass in index 0 and repeatedly call the function by passing in the last returned result, the process should look as such:

Next(0) -> returns Array[1] n -> Next(n) -> returns Array[2] n -> Next(n) -> returns Array[0] n -> Next(n) -> returns Array[1] ...


You can implement these features into your engine simply by adding the code in ArrayNext.h into a public section of Source/Runtime/Core/Public/Containers/Array.h
